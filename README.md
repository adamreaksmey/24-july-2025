# 27-jul-2025.com — Cambodia's Voice in the Digital Battlefield

> _On July 24th, 2025 at 8:30AM, Thailand fired the first shot — and ignited a war._

This website is not just code. It's resistance. It's memory. It's justice.

Thailand launched an unprovoked attack against Cambodia — firing into our territory, destroying villages, and **bombing the sacred Preah Vihear Temple**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that stood for centuries.

But Cambodia did not kneel.

From the veterans of the Pol Pot era to the digital defenders of today, **we stood, we fought, we built**. This site is part of that resistance.

## 📣 Mission

## 🇰🇭 Cambodia Will Not Be Silenced

Thailand may have superior jets and tanks.  
But we have something stronger: **our unity, our history, and our fire**.

> "They bombed us at 4AM. One of our men lit a cigarette, grabbed his RPG, and walked out shirtless to defend his land."
